### Hello there üßîüèº

I'm Giulio Mazzanti, a Software Engineer based in Milan (Italy).

I'm currently leading the Engineering team at [Quick Algorithm](https://quickalgorithm.com/), a startup working on Scops, a platform for advanced maintenance based on IoT data (CMMS / Asset Performance Management).

My interests are at the intersection of Data-Intensive Web Applications, Cloud Architectures, AI Product Design & recently IoT (specifically LoRaWAN).

I code mostly in Python in my day-to-day work (e.g. Airflow, Flask, FastAPI, various ML tools). I enjoyed trying out functional languages like Scala. Recently I'm working on some small projects in Rust.

I recently graduated in a MSc in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, previously I did my BSc at Bocconi University ([BEMACS](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/economics+management+and+computer+science)).
